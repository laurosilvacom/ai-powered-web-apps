Practice by building small projects, then learn hooks, context, and more advanced patterns. Online courses, documentation, and community resources can help guide your journey.'

You can also check out freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, and YouTube channels like Traversy Media or Web Dev Simplified. GitHub repositories with starter projects are great for hands-on practice.'

					"Quantum computing uses quantum bits or 'qubits' instead of regular bits. While normal bits can be either 0 or 1, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously thanks to 'superposition.' This allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of possibilities at once, potentially solving complex problems much faster than traditional computers."

While still developing, these applications could revolutionize multiple industries.'
